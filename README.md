## Building Executable

Surfscape uses a professional Makefile-based build system that works across Linux, macOS, and Windows platforms. The build system uses PyInstaller to create standalone executables that include all dependencies.

### Build System

- `Makefile` - Professional cross-platform build system
- `surfscape.spec` - PyInstaller specification file
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- Legacy scripts: `build.sh`, `build.bat`, `clean.sh`, `clean.bat` (deprecated)

### Prerequisites for Building

#### System Dependencies

**Linux/Unix:**
- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip3
- make (usually pre-installed)
- Development packages for audio (for PyAudio)

On Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-dev portaudio19-dev build-essential
```

On CentOS/RHEL/Fedora:
```bash
sudo dnf install python3-devel portaudio-devel make
# or for older versions:
sudo yum install python3-devel portaudio-devel make
```

**macOS:**
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Xcode Command Line Tools
- Homebrew (recommended)

```bash
xcode-select --install
brew install portaudio
```

**Windows:**
- Python 3.6 or higher (from python.org)
- Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools
- make utility (via Chocolatey, MSYS2, or WSL)

```cmd
# Using Chocolatey
choco install make

# Or use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
```

### Quick Start

The easiest way to build Surfscape is using the Makefile:

```bash
# See all available commands
make help

# Install system dependencies (Linux only)
make install-system-deps

# Build the executable (installs Python deps automatically)
make build

# Run from source (for development)
make run

# Clean build artifacts
make clean
```

### Available Make Targets

#### Build Targets
- `make build` - Build the executable (default target)
- `make package` - Create distribution package
- `make debug` - Build with debug information

#### Development Targets
- `make deps` - Install Python dependencies
- `make venv` - Create virtual environment
- `make install` - Install in development mode
- `make run` - Run from source
- `make format` - Format code with black

#### Quality Assurance
- `make check` - Run code quality checks (flake8, pylint, black)
- `make test` - Run test suite

#### Maintenance Targets
- `make clean` - Clean build artifacts
- `make clean-all` - Clean everything including virtual environment
- `make info` - Show project information
- `make update-deps` - Update dependencies

#### CI/CD Targets
- `make ci` - Full CI pipeline (deps, check, test, build)
- `make release` - Prepare release package

### Build Output

The executable will be created in the `dist/` directory:
- **Linux/Unix:** `dist/surfscape`
- **macOS:** `dist/surfscape`
- **Windows:** `dist/surfscape.exe`

### Advanced Build Configuration

#### Virtual Environment

The Makefile automatically manages a Python virtual environment in the `venv/` directory. This ensures clean dependency management and doesn't interfere with your system Python installation.

#### Cross-Platform Support

The Makefile automatically detects your platform and adjusts build commands accordingly:
- Uses `python3` on Linux/macOS, falls back to `python` on Windows
- Sets correct executable extensions (`.exe` on Windows)
- Handles different virtual environment activation scripts

#### Customizing the Build

You can customize the build by editing `surfscape.spec`:

```python
# Add custom icon
icon='path/to/icon.ico'  # Windows
icon='path/to/icon.icns'  # macOS

# Exclude modules to reduce size
excludes=['module_to_exclude']

# Add hidden imports
hiddenimports=['your_module']
```

### Cleaning Build Artifacts

To clean build artifacts:

```bash
# Clean build files only
make clean

# Clean everything including virtual environment
make clean-all
```

### Legacy Build Scripts

The project still includes the original build scripts for compatibility:
- `build.sh` (Linux/Unix)
- `build.bat` (Windows)
- `clean.sh` (Linux/Unix)
- `clean.bat` (Windows)

However, it's recommended to use the Makefile for new development as it provides better dependency management and cross-platform support.

### Distribution

The built executable can be distributed as a single file. Users don't need Python or any dependencies installed.

Use `make package` to create a complete distribution package that includes the executable, documentation, and other assets.

#### System Requirements for End Users

- **Linux**: glibc 2.17+ (most modern distributions)
- **Windows**: Windows 7 SP1+ (64-bit)
- **macOS**: macOS 10.9+ (if building on macOS)

## Development Dependencies

If you want to run Surfscape from source code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- [Python 3.6 or above](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [PyQt6](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt6/)
- [PyQt6 WebEngine](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt6-WebEngine/)
- [Adblockparser](https://pypi.org/project/adblockparser/)
- [Anthropic](https://pypi.org/project/anthropic/)
- [PyAudio](https://pypi.org/project/PyAudio/)
- [SpeechRecognition](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/)
- [markdown](https://pypi.org/project/markdown/)

You can install these dependencies using `pip`, the Python package installer. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
pip install PyQt6 PyQt6-WebEngine adblockparser anthropic pyaudio SpeechRecognition markdown
```

Or you can install these dependencies using the package manager of your favorite Linux Distribution.

### Running from Source

After installing dependencies using the Makefile, you can run Surfscape directly:

```bash
# Using the Makefile (recommended)
make run

# Or manually
python3 surfscape.py
```

## Build Troubleshooting

### Common Build Issues

1. **Make command not found**:
   - **Linux/macOS**: Install build tools with `sudo apt-get install build-essential` or `xcode-select --install`
   - **Windows**: Install make via Chocolatey (`choco install make`) or use WSL

2. **PyAudio installation fails**:
   - **Linux**: Use `make install-system-deps` to install system dependencies
   - **macOS**: Install with `brew install portaudio`
   - **Windows**: Install Visual C++ Build Tools

3. **Python virtual environment issues**:
   - Run `make clean-all` then `make build` to recreate the environment
   - Ensure Python 3.6+ is installed and accessible

4. **Missing modules in executable**:
   - Add missing modules to `hiddenimports` in `surfscape.spec`
   - Use `make debug` to build with verbose output

5. **Large executable size**:
   - Review dependencies in `requirements.txt`
   - Add unused packages to `excludes` in `surfscape.spec`

6. **Permission denied errors**:
   - Ensure you have write permissions in the project directory
   - On Linux/macOS, the Makefile automatically sets executable permissions

### Development Workflow

For active development, use these commands:

```bash
# Set up development environment
make venv deps

# Run code quality checks
make check

# Format code
make format

# Run tests
make test

# Run from source
make run

# Build when ready
make build
```

### CI/CD Integration

The Makefile includes targets designed for continuous integration:

```bash
# Full CI pipeline
make ci

# Prepare release
make release
```

### Version Control

The project includes a comprehensive `.gitignore` file that excludes:
- Python cache files and bytecode
- Build artifacts and distribution files
- Virtual environments
- IDE configuration files
- OS-specific files
- Temporary files

This ensures that only source code and essential configuration files are tracked in version control.

### Customizing the Build

#### Adding an Icon

To add an icon to the executable:

1. Place your icon file in the project directory
2. Edit `surfscape.spec` and update the `icon` parameter:
   ```python
   # For Windows
   icon='icon.ico'
   
   # For macOS
   icon='icon.icns'
   ```

#### Build Options

The PyInstaller spec file (`surfscape.spec`) can be customized:

- `console=False` - Creates a windowed application (no console)
- `upx=True` - Enables UPX compression (if UPX is installed)
- `onefile=True` - Creates a single executable file
- `debug=False` - Disables debug output

## Tor Setup

To configure Tor to use specific ports and enable cookie authentication, add the following lines to your `torrc` file:

```
ControlPort 9051
SocksPort 9050
CookieAuthentication 1
```

The `torrc` file is typically located in `/etc/tor/` on Linux or in the HOME directory on Windows.

To start Tor via `systemctl` using your Linux Distribution of choice, run the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl start tor
```

To enable Tor to start at boot, use:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable tor
```

Alternatively, on Windows, you can configure Tor to start at boot by creating a shortcut to `tor.exe` in the Startup folder. Follow these steps:

1. Press `Win + R`, type `shell:startup`, and press Enter.
2. Create a shortcut to `tor.exe` in the Startup folder.

This will ensure Tor starts automatically when you log in to your Windows account.

After these steps you can enable or disable Tor via Surfscape Browser Settings.
