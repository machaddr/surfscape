- [PyQt6](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt6/)
- [PyQt6 WebEngine](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt6-WebEngine/)
- [Adblockparser](https://pypi.org/project/adblockparser/)

You can install these dependencies using `pip`, the Python package installer. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
pip install PyQt6 PyQt6-WebEngine adblockparser
```

Or you can install these dependencies using the package manager of your favorite Linux Distribution.

## Tor Setup

To configure Tor to use specific ports and enable cookie authentication, add the following lines to your `torrc` file:

```
ControlPort 9051
SocksPort 9050
CookieAuthentication 1
```

The `torrc` file is typically located in `/etc/tor/` on Linux or in the HOME directory on Windows.

To start Tor via `systemctl` using your Linux Distribution of choice, run the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl start tor
```

To enable Tor to start at boot, use:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable tor
```

Alternatively, on Windows, you can configure Tor to start at boot by creating a shortcut to `tor.exe` in the Startup folder. Follow these steps:

1. Press `Win + R`, type `shell:startup`, and press Enter.
2. Create a shortcut to `tor.exe` in the Startup folder.

This will ensure Tor starts automatically when you log in to your Windows account.

After these steps you can enable or disable Tor via Surfscape Browser Settings.
