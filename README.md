## Building Executable

The project includes a complete build system that uses PyInstaller to create standalone executables for both Linux/Unix and Windows platforms. The build process creates a single executable file that includes all dependencies.

### Build Files

- `build.sh` - Linux/Unix build script
- `build.bat` - Windows build script
- `clean.sh` - Linux/Unix cleanup script
- `clean.bat` - Windows cleanup script
- `surfscape.spec` - PyInstaller specification file
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

### Prerequisites for Building

#### For Linux/Unix:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip3
- Development packages for audio (for PyAudio)

On Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-dev portaudio19-dev
```

On CentOS/RHEL/Fedora:
```bash
sudo yum install python3-devel portaudio-devel
# or for newer versions:
sudo dnf install python3-devel portaudio-devel
```

#### For Windows:
- Python 3.6 or higher (from python.org)
- Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools (for some packages)

### Building

#### Linux/Unix

1. Open a terminal in the project directory
2. Run the build script:
   ```bash
   ./build.sh
   ```

The script will:
- Create a virtual environment
- Install all dependencies
- Clean previous builds
- Build the executable using PyInstaller
- Test the executable

#### Windows

1. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell in the project directory
2. Run the build script:
   ```cmd
   build.bat
   ```

The script will:
- Create a virtual environment
- Install all dependencies
- Clean previous builds
- Build the executable using PyInstaller

### Build Output

The executable will be created in the `dist/` directory:
- Linux/Unix: `dist/surfscape`
- Windows: `dist/surfscape.exe`

### Cleaning Build Artifacts

To clean all build artifacts:

#### Linux/Unix:
```bash
./clean.sh
```

#### Windows:
```cmd
clean.bat
```

### Distribution

The built executable can be distributed as a single file. Users don't need Python or any dependencies installed.

#### System Requirements for End Users

- **Linux**: glibc 2.17+ (most modern distributions)
- **Windows**: Windows 7 SP1+ (64-bit)
- **macOS**: macOS 10.9+ (if building on macOS)

## Development Dependencies

If you want to run Surfscape from source code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- [Python 3.6 or above](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [PyQt6](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt6/)
- [PyQt6 WebEngine](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt6-WebEngine/)
- [Adblockparser](https://pypi.org/project/adblockparser/)
- [Anthropic](https://pypi.org/project/anthropic/)
- [PyAudio](https://pypi.org/project/PyAudio/)
- [SpeechRecognition](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/)
- [markdown](https://pypi.org/project/markdown/)

You can install these dependencies using `pip`, the Python package installer. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
pip install PyQt6 PyQt6-WebEngine adblockparser anthropic pyaudio SpeechRecognition markdown
```

Or you can install these dependencies using the package manager of your favorite Linux Distribution.

### Running from Source

After installing dependencies, you can run Surfscape directly:

```bash
python3 surfscape.py
```

## Build Troubleshooting

### Common Build Issues

1. **PyAudio installation fails**:
   - Install system audio development packages (see Prerequisites)
   - On Windows, you may need Visual C++ Build Tools

2. **Missing modules in executable**:
   - Add missing modules to `hiddenimports` in `surfscape.spec`

3. **Large executable size**:
   - Review dependencies in `requirements.txt`
   - Consider using `--exclude-module` for unused packages

4. **Executable doesn't start**:
   - Run with `--debug` flag to see detailed output
   - Check for missing system libraries with `ldd` (Linux) or Dependency Walker (Windows)

### Customizing the Build

#### Adding an Icon

To add an icon to the executable:

1. Place your icon file in the project directory
2. Edit `surfscape.spec` and update the `icon` parameter:
   ```python
   # For Windows
   icon='icon.ico'
   
   # For macOS
   icon='icon.icns'
   ```

#### Build Options

The PyInstaller spec file (`surfscape.spec`) can be customized:

- `console=False` - Creates a windowed application (no console)
- `upx=True` - Enables UPX compression (if UPX is installed)
- `onefile=True` - Creates a single executable file
- `debug=False` - Disables debug output

## Tor Setup

To configure Tor to use specific ports and enable cookie authentication, add the following lines to your `torrc` file:

```
ControlPort 9051
SocksPort 9050
CookieAuthentication 1
```

The `torrc` file is typically located in `/etc/tor/` on Linux or in the HOME directory on Windows.

To start Tor via `systemctl` using your Linux Distribution of choice, run the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl start tor
```

To enable Tor to start at boot, use:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable tor
```

Alternatively, on Windows, you can configure Tor to start at boot by creating a shortcut to `tor.exe` in the Startup folder. Follow these steps:

1. Press `Win + R`, type `shell:startup`, and press Enter.
2. Create a shortcut to `tor.exe` in the Startup folder.

This will ensure Tor starts automatically when you log in to your Windows account.

After these steps you can enable or disable Tor via Surfscape Browser Settings.

## I2P Setup

### Linux

1. **Install I2P:**
    You can install I2P using your distribution's package manager. For example, on Debian-based systems, run:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install i2p
    ```

2. **Start I2P:**
    To start I2P, use the following command:
    ```bash
    i2prouter start
    ```

3. **Enable I2P to start at boot:**
    To ensure I2P starts automatically at boot, use:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable i2p
    ```

4. **Configure I2P:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:7657` to access the I2P router console. Configure your I2P settings as needed.

### Windows

1. **Download I2P:**
    Download the I2P installer from the [official I2P website](https://geti2p.net/en/download).

2. **Install I2P:**
    Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install I2P.

3. **Start I2P:**
    After installation, start I2P from the Start Menu or by running `i2prouter` from the command prompt.

4. **Configure I2P:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:7657` to access the I2P router console. Configure your I2P settings as needed.

5. **Enable I2P to start at boot:**
    To configure I2P to start at boot, create a shortcut to `i2prouter.exe` in the Startup folder. Follow these steps:
    1. Press `Win + R`, type `shell:startup`, and press Enter.
    2. Create a shortcut to `i2prouter.exe` in the Startup folder.

After these steps, you can enable or disable I2P via Surfscape Browser Settings.
